    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would first of all advice them to not have an easy password. computer generated passwords usually are safer passwords, as it is randomly put together and includes small and big letters, numbers and often special signs. Secondly I would addvice the customer to have a dual autenthication, because it reduces the risk of hacking and other people gaining access to your account/site. Why dual autenthication is adviced is because you are only able to gain access through another device which only you have access to. An example of such sould be a mobile device. Third the customer could also make use of a trusted and tested third party application. </a></p>
